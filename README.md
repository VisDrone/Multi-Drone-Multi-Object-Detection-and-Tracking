# Multi-Drone-Multi-Object-Detection-and-Tracking

## Dataset

To address the critical challenges of identity association and target occlusion in multi-drone multi-target tracking tasks, we collect an occlusion-aware multi-drone multi-target tracking dataset named MDMT. It contains 88 video sequences with 39,678 frames, including 11,454 different IDs of persons, bicycles, and cars.
